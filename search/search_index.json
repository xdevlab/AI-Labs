By default this directory is located in your home directory (e.g. <code>\\Users\\yourname</code> on Windows), but you can select where it goes at install time.</p> <p>After installation, you can delete the install directory (the one that the zip file creates when it unpacks). Do not delete or move the <code>invokeai</code> directory!</p> <p>Initialization file <code>invokeai/invokeai.init</code></p> <p>You can place frequently-used startup options in this file, such as the default number of steps or your preferred sampler. To keep everything in one place, this file has now been moved into the <code>invokeai</code> directory and is named <code>invokeai.init</code>.</p> <p>To update from Version 2.2.3</p> <p>The easiest route is to download and unpack one of the 2.2.4 installer files. When it asks you for the location of the <code>invokeai</code> runtime directory, respond with the path to the directory that contains your 2.2.3 <code>invokeai</code>. That is, if <code>invokeai</code> lives at <code>C:\\Users\\fred\\invokeai</code>, then answer with <code>C:\\Users\\fred</code> and answer \"Y\" when asked if you want to reuse the directory.</p> <p>The <code>update.sh</code> (<code>update.bat</code>) script that came with the 2.2.3 source installer does not know about the new directory layout and won't be fully functional.</p> <p>To update to 2.2.5 (and beyond) there's now an update path</p> <p>As they become available, you can update to more recent versions of InvokeAI using an <code>update.sh</code> (<code>update.bat</code>) script located in the <code>invokeai</code> directory. Running it without any arguments will install the most recent version of InvokeAI. Alternatively, you can get set releases by running the <code>update.sh</code> script with an argument in the command shell.

Latent space represents compressed inputs. It\u2019s in latent space that Stable Diffusion processes images. A VAE (Variational Auto Encoder) is responsible for compressing and encoding inputs into latent space, as well as decoding outputs back into image space.</p> <p>To fully understand the diffusion process, we need to understand a few more terms: UNet, CLIP, and conditioning.</p> <p>A U-Net is a model trained on a large number of latent images with with known amounts of random noise added.  This means that the U-Net can be given a slightly noisy image and it will predict the pattern of noise needed to subtract from the image in order to recover the original. </p> <p>CLIP is a model that tokenizes and encodes text into conditioning. This conditioning guides the model during the denoising steps to produce a new image. </p> <p>The U-Net and CLIP work together during the image generation process at each denoising step, with the U-Net removing noise in such a way that the result is similar to images in the U-Net\u2019s training set, while CLIP guides the U-Net towards creating images that are most similar to the prompt.</p> <p>When you generate an image using text-to-image, multiple steps occur in latent space: 1. Random noise is generated at the chosen height and width. The noise\u2019s characteristics are dictated by  seed. This noise tensor is passed into latent space. We\u2019ll call this noise A. 2. Using a model\u2019s U-Net, a noise predictor examines noise A, and the words tokenized by CLIP from your prompt (conditioning). It generates its own noise tensor to predict what the final image might look like in latent space. We\u2019ll call this noise B. 3. Noise B is subtracted from noise A in an attempt to create a latent image consistent with the prompt. This step is repeated for the number of sampler steps chosen. 4. The VAE decodes the final latent image from latent space into image space.</p> <p>Image-to-image is a similar process, with only step 1 being different: 1. The input image is encoded from image space into latent space by the VAE. Noise is then added to the input latent image. Denoising Strength dictates how may noise steps are added, and the amount of noise added at each step. A Denoising Strength of 0 means there are 0 steps and no noise added, resulting in an unchanged image, while a Denoising Strength of 1 results in the image being completely replaced with noise and a full set of denoising steps are performance. The process is then the same as steps 2-4 in the text-to-image process. </p> <p>Furthermore, a model provides the CLIP prompt tokenizer, the VAE, and a U-Net (where noise prediction occurs given a prompt and initial noise tensor).</p> <p>A noise scheduler (eg. DPM++ 2M Karras) schedules the subtraction of noise from the latent image across the sampler steps chosen (step 3 above). Less noise is usually subtracted at higher sampler steps. </p>"},{"location":"help/gettingStartedWithAI/","title":"Getting Started with AI Image Generation","text":"<p>New to image generation with AI?

You may restart it and it will pick up where it left off.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Post-install Configuration: After installation completes, the     installer will launch the configuration form, which will guide you     through the first-time process of adjusting some of InvokeAI's     startup settings. To move around this form use ctrl-N for     &lt;N&gt;ext and ctrl-P for &lt;P&gt;revious, or use &lt;tab&gt;     and shift-&lt;tab&gt; to move forward and back. Once you are in a     multi-checkbox field use the up and down cursor keys to select the     item you want, and &lt;space&gt; to toggle it on and off.  Within     a directory field, pressing &lt;tab&gt; will provide autocomplete     options.</p> <p>Generally the defaults are fine, and you can come back to this screen at any time to tweak your system. Here are the options you can adjust:</p> <ul> <li> <p>HuggingFace Access Token   InvokeAI has the ability to download embedded styles and subjects   from the HuggingFace Concept Library on-demand. However, some of   the concept library files are password protected. To make download   smoother, you can set up an account at huggingface.co, obtain an   access token, and paste it into this field. Note that you paste   to this screen using ctrl-shift-V</p> </li> <li> <p>Free GPU memory after each generation     This is useful for low-memory machines and helps minimize the amount of GPU VRAM used by InvokeAI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable xformers support if available     If the xformers library was successfully installed, this will activate it to reduce memory consumption and increase rendering speed noticeably. Note that xformers has the side effect of generating slightly different images even when presented with the same seed and other settings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Force CPU to be used on GPU systems     This will use the (slow) CPU rather than the accelerated GPU. This can be used to generate images on systems that don't have a compatible GPU.</p> </li> <li> <p>Precision     This controls whether to use float32 or float16 arithmetic. float16 uses less memory but is also slightly less accurate. Ordinarily the right arithmetic is picked automatically (\"auto\"), but you may have to use float32 to get images on certain systems and graphics cards. The \"autocast\" option is deprecated and shouldn't be used unless you are asked to by a member of the team.</p> </li> <li> <p>Size of the RAM cache used for fast model switching*     This allows you to keep models in memory and switch rapidly among them rather than having them load from disk each time. This slider controls how many models to keep loaded at once. A typical SD-1 or SD-2 model uses 2-3 GB of memory. A typical SDXL model uses 6-7 GB. Providing more RAM will allow more models to be co-resident.</p> </li> <li> <p>Output directory for images   This is the path to a directory in which InvokeAI will store all its   generated images.</p> </li> <li> <p>Autoimport Folder   This is the directory in which you can place models you have   downloaded and wish to load into InvokeAI. You can place a variety   of models in this directory, including diffusers folders, .ckpt files,   .safetensors files, as well as LoRAs, ControlNet and Textual Inversion   files (both folder and file versions). To help organize this folder,   you can create several levels of subfolders and drop your models into   whichever ones you want.</p> </li> <li> <p>LICENSE </p> </li> </ul> <p>At the bottom of the screen you will see a checkbox for accepting the CreativeML Responsible AI Licenses. You need to accept the license in order to download Stable Diffusion models from the next screen.</p> <p>You can come back to the startup options form as many times as you like. From the <code>invoke.sh</code> or <code>invoke.bat</code> launcher, select option (6) to relaunch this script. On the command line, it is named <code>invokeai-configure</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Downloading Models: After you press <code>[NEXT]</code> on the screen, you will be taken     to another screen that prompts you to download a series of starter models. The ones     we recommend are preselected for you, but you are encouraged to use the checkboxes to     pick and choose.     You will probably wish to download <code>autoencoder-840000</code> for use with models that     were trained with an older version of the Stability VAE.</p> <p> </p> <p>Below the preselected list of starter models is a large text field which you can use to specify a series of models to import. You can specify models in a variety of formats, each separated by a space or newline. The formats accepted are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The path to a .ckpt or .safetensors file. On most systems, you can drag a file from   the file browser to the textfield to automatically paste the path. Be sure to remove   extraneous quotation marks and other things that come along for the ride.</p> </li> <li> <p>The path to a directory containing a combination of <code>.ckpt</code> and <code>.safetensors</code> files.   The directory will be scanned from top to bottom (including subfolders) and any   file that can be imported will be.</p> </li> <li> <p>A URL pointing to a <code>.ckpt</code> or <code>.safetensors</code> file. You can cut   and paste directly from a web page, or simply drag the link from the web page   or navigation bar. (You can also use ctrl-shift-V to paste into this field)   The file will be downloaded and installed.</p> </li> <li> <p>The HuggingFace repository ID (repo_id) for a <code>diffusers</code> model. These IDs have    the format author_name/model_name, as in <code>andite/anything-v4.0</code></p> </li> <li> <p>The path to a local directory containing a <code>diffusers</code>   model. These directories always have the file <code>model_index.json</code>   at their top level.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Select a directory for models to import You may select a local directory for autoimporting at startup time. If you select this option, the directory you choose will be scanned for new .ckpt/.safetensors files each time InvokeAI starts up, and any new files will be automatically imported and made available for your use.</p> <p>Convert imported models into diffusers When legacy checkpoint files are imported, you may select to use them unmodified (the default) or to convert them into <code>diffusers</code> models. The latter load much faster and have slightly better rendering performance, but not all checkpoint files can be converted. Note that Stable Diffusion Version 2.X files are only supported in <code>diffusers</code> format and will be converted regardless.</p> <p>You can come back to the model install form as many times as you like.  From the <code>invoke.sh</code> or <code>invoke.bat</code> launcher, select option (5) to relaunch  this script. On the command line, it is named <code>invokeai-model-install</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Running InvokeAI for the first time: The script will now exit and you'll be ready to generate some images. Look     for the directory <code>invokeai</code> installed in the location you chose at the     beginning of the install session. Look for a shell script named <code>invoke.sh</code>     (Linux/Mac) or <code>invoke.bat</code> (Windows). Launch the script by double-clicking     it or typing its name at the command-line:</p> <pre><code>C:\\Documents\\Linco&gt; cd invokeai\nC:\\Documents\\Linco\\invokeAI&gt; invoke.bat\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>invoke.bat</code> (<code>invoke.sh</code>) script will give you the choice   of starting (1) the command-line interface, (2) the web GUI, (3)   textual inversion training, and (4) model merging.</p> </li> <li> <p>By default, the script will launch the web interface. When you   do this, you'll see a series of startup messages ending with   instructions to point your browser at   http://localhost:9090. Click on this link to open up a browser   and start exploring InvokeAI's features.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>InvokeAI Options: You can launch InvokeAI with several different command-line arguments that     customize its behavior. For example, you can change the location of the     image output directory or balance memory usage vs performance. See     Configuration for a full list of the options.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To set defaults that will take effect every time you launch InvokeAI,   use a text editor (e.g. Notepad) to exit the file   <code>invokeai\\invokeai.init</code>. It contains a variety of examples that you can   follow to add and modify launch options.</p> </li> <li> <p>The launcher script also offers you an option labeled \"open the developer   console\". If you choose this option, you will be dropped into a   command-line interface in which you can run python commands directly,   access developer tools, and launch InvokeAI with customized options.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Do not move or remove the <code>invokeai</code> directory</p> <p>The <code>invokeai</code> directory contains the <code>invokeai</code> application, its configuration files, the model weight files, and outputs of image generation.

For example, if an image is only 512x768 total, the face might only be 128x128   or 256x256, much smaller than the 512x512 your SD1.5 model was probably   trained on. Try increasing the resolution of the image by upscaling or   resizing, add padding to increase the bounding box's resolution, or use an   image where the face takes up more pixels.</li> <li>If the resulting face seems out of place pasted back on the original image   (ie. too large, not proportional), add more padding on the FaceOff node to   give inpainting more context. Context and good prompting are important to   keeping things proportional.</li> <li>If you find the mask is too big/small and going too far outside/inside the   area you want to affect, adjust the x &amp; y offsets to shrink/grow the mask area</li> <li>Use a higher denoise start value to resemble aspects of the original face or   surroundings. Denoise start = 0 &amp; denoise end = 1 will make something new,   while denoise start = 0.50 &amp; denoise end = 1 will be 50% old and 50% new.</li> <li>mediapipe isn't good at detecting faces with lots of face paint, hair covering   the face, etc. Anything that obstructs the face will likely result in no faces   being detected.</li> <li>If you find your face isn't being detected, try lowering the minimum   confidence value from 0.5. This could result in false positives, however   (random areas being detected as faces and masked).</li> <li>After altering an image and wanting to process a different face in the newly   altered image, run the altered image through FaceIdentifier again to see the   new Face IDs.
